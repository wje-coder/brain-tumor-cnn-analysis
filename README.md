# Brain Tumor Detection Using ResNet Models

This repository includes my part of a group project focused on detecting brain tumors using convolutional neural networks. My responsibility was to implement and evaluate ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 on MRI brain scans. I focused on training, testing, and using interpretability tools like Grad-CAM and SHAP to better understand what the models were learning.

The main goal was to compare model performance and see how deep learning could help identify tumors more accurately. I used accuracy scores, visual explanations, and timing observations to compare the two ResNet models. All code and results related to my part are included here.

Other models like AlexNet and MobileNet were handled by my teammate and are not part of this upload. This repo focuses only on the work I personally completed.

## Project Overview

This project explored the use of deep learning in medical image classification, specifically to detect brain tumors in MRI images. I used ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 because of their strong performance in computer vision tasks. Both models were trained and evaluated using the same dataset. I applied Grad-CAM and SHAP to show what parts of the image influenced the modelâ€™s decision.
